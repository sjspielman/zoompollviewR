View your Zoom Poll results in a shiny app

**This app is a work in progress. Please file any issues to report bugs or request features!** 

To finish the app, I am in desperate need of test cases and poll reports to check over. If you have a poll report that does NOT work on the app, please share it with me as a github issue! **If you want to share a report with me, please make sure it is DE-IDENTIFIED with student names and emails replaced with random text instead.** If you aren't sure how to do this, email me the report at `spielman <at> rowan <dot> edu` and I will de-identify immediately for you.

Currently known to NOT WORK:
- Anonymous polls. All individuals answering the poll questions must be appropriately registered for the Zoom meeting
- Reports with multiple polls. Only reports with a result from a single poll will work right now
